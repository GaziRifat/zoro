		<h3>about Zoro</h3>
		<b>A Determined Swordsman from Childhood</b>
		<p>
			Roronoa Zoro’s journey began in Shimotsuki Village, where he trained at a dojo under the guidance of Koushirou. As a child, Zoro showed exceptional determination, challenging even adults to sword fights. Despite his talent, he could never defeat Kuina, the dojo master’s daughter and his fiercest rival. After Kuina’s tragic death, Zoro vowed to fulfill her dream of becoming the world’s greatest swordsman, making it his life’s mission.
		</p>
		<b>A Bounty Hunter with Purpose</b>
		<p>
			Zoro set out into the world, earning a reputation as a bounty hunter while sharpening his swordsmanship. His skills with the unique Three-Sword Style (Santoryu) made him a formidable fighter. Despite his rough exterior, Zoro demonstrated a strong sense of honor and justice, refusing to back down against those who threatened his values.
		</p>
		<b>Joining Luffy’s Crew</b>
		<p>
			Zoro’s fate changed when he crossed paths with Monkey D. Luffy. Captured and tied up by the Marines, Zoro agreed to join Luffy’s crew after the captain saved him and his swords. From then on, he became the first member of the Straw Hat Pirates, pledging his loyalty to Luffy and dedicating himself to their shared adventures.
		</p>
		<b>Goals and Dreams</b>
		<p>
			Zoro’s ultimate goal is to become the world’s greatest swordsman, a title currently held by Dracule Mihawk. His journey reflects his unwavering resolve to grow stronger, protect his crewmates, and honor his promise to Kuina.
