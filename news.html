				<h3>Journey so far</h3>
				<p>
					Roronoa Zoro’s journey begins in Shimotsuki Village, where he trained in swordsmanship at Koushirou's dojo. As a young and fiery swordsman, Zoro possessed raw talent and an indomitable will to succeed. Despite his best efforts, he could never surpass Kuina, the dojo master’s daughter and his greatest rival. Her tragic death profoundly impacted Zoro, as he vowed to fulfill their shared dream of becoming the world’s strongest swordsman. This moment marked the birth of Zoro’s lifelong dedication to his craft and his promise to honor Kuina's memory. His humble beginnings shaped his determination and laid the foundation for the disciplined and ambitious warrior we see today.
				</p>
				<p>
					As Zoro ventured into the world, he became a bounty hunter to hone his skills and support his mission to become the strongest. He developed a fearsome reputation, wielding the Three-Sword Style, Santoryu, a unique technique that showcased his creativity and raw power. Though independent, Zoro demonstrated a strong moral compass, fighting for justice when necessary. His journey as a lone swordsman revealed his resilience and growing strength. It also highlighted his solitary nature and need for a larger purpose, which would soon come when he crossed paths with Monkey D. Luffy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Zoro’s fateful encounter with Luffy marked a turning point in his life. After being captured by Marines, Zoro agreed to join the Straw Hat crew when Luffy saved him from execution and returned his swords. His decision symbolized the start of his loyalty to Luffy, someone who respected his dreams and strength. As the first member of the Straw Hats, Zoro became a pivotal figure, both as a protector and as a source of wisdom for the crew. This marked his transition from a lone warrior to a part of a team united by shared goals.
