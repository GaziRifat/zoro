						I have edited the website pages and have added a few pictures. I have adjusted the picture sizes accordingly. Unfortunately, I was unable to work on CSS because when I tried editing it, it kept ruining the website, probably due to my own mistake. Due to pressure of other finals and deadlines, I was unable to continue on CSS.
